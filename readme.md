# Ruby Event Manager
This program takes a CSV of registration information from a hypothetical political event, and then generates customized thank you letters to the participants which contains the names of the participant's local government representatives based on the zipcode the participant provided.
It also analyzes the registration date to determine which day and which hour were the most popular registration times.
